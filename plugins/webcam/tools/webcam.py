# Webcam capture tool — lets the AI request a snapshot from the user's camera.
#
# Flow:
# 1. AI calls capture_webcam
# 2. Tool blocks, waiting for browser to deliver an image
# 3. Browser JS detects tool_start event, captures webcam, POSTs image
# 4. Tool unblocks, returns image via standard tool image infrastructure
#
# Shared state: both this tool and routes/capture.py need access to the same
# pending capture slot. Since plugin_loader uses exec() for each file, they
# get isolated namespaces. We use sys.modules to store a shared state module
# that both sides can access.
